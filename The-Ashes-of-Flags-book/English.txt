**The Ashes of Flags**

Istanbul, a city filled with the energy of football fandom, once became a battleground of blood and fire. Our story begins in the midst of fierce rivalries among the supporters of Istanbul's three great teams: Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, and Beşiktaş. Initially, the clashes were limited to chants and minor skirmishes, but over time, they escalated into full-blown warfare.

The fans divided the city into territories. Beşiktaş supporters controlled the northern shores, Fenerbahçe held the Asian side, and Galatasaray seized the historic heart of Istanbul. The army and police intervened to restore order, but the rage and determination of the fans rendered these efforts futile.

Months passed, and the conflict intensified. Each team’s stronghold turned into an impenetrable fortress. Illegal arms flooded the city, and the fights expanded beyond just fans, involving terrorist groups. Galatasaray supporters, now split into factions, allied with these armed forces. Meanwhile, Beşiktaş fans, under heavy pressure, were losing their grip on their territory.

Eventually, the army managed to reclaim parts of the city, pushing out Beşiktaş and Fenerbahçe. However, Galatasaray, fortified with heavy weapons and militant support, continued their resistance. The war dragged on for months, leaving the city in ruins.

After a year of bloodshed, Kurdish forces from eastern Turkey entered the fray, seizing vast territories. Their leader, Arif Jahannami, managed to push back the Turkish army and take control of several eastern cities. Yet internal betrayal and rebellion among Arif’s forces led to his capture and a gruesome end at the hands of the military.

Ten years later, Turkey barely found a semblance of peace. Football was banned nationwide, and a united flag representing all teams was raised alongside the national flag of Turkey. This flag symbolized unity, but over time, the government decided to lower it, declaring it was time for everyone to unite under one single flag.

This decision left some citizens discontent, but the nation was weary of chaos, and no one dared to stir rebellion. Yet, some of the older fans, nostalgic and defiant, formed underground groups to keep the memory of their teams alive.

Fifty years later, an elderly Beşiktaş supporter, who had lived through those turbulent times, recounted the stories of the past to his grandson. He spoke of the days when Beşiktaş held the northern shores, of the bravery, betrayals, and hardships they endured to survive. The grandson listened intently, asking questions and becoming more curious.

One day, the grandson declared, "Grandfather, my friends and I have decided to revive the name of Beşiktaş. This time, we will fight against the government and bring back the name." The old man, with decades of experience in war and suffering, smiled and said, "If you believe this is the right path, then go ahead. But never forget that freedom and peace come at the cost of blood."

Months later, the youth raised the united flag of the teams once again, taking control of Istanbul. But this move prompted a fierce military response, and another battle erupted. Many young lives were lost, including the grandson. The news of his death reached the grandfather over the phone. Alone and the last survivor of his generation, the old man reflected on the days he had fought amidst fire and blood for survival.

Arrested for inciting rebellion against the government, the old man, standing at the gallows, smiled one last time and whispered to himself, "We may have perished, but our name will never be forgotten."
